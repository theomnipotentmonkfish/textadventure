You walk into a kitchen. <br />
<br />
<br />
Gosh! What an inordinate number of oddly sized shelves, you think. <br />
So much... wood, you marvel.<br />
What a complete lack of... any kind of cupboard.<br />
What a large array of cocktail ingredients and coffee paraphanalia, to be owned by a person who you usually see avoiding caffeine and alcohol, you muse.<br />
Why is the sink full of miniature slugs?! You exclaim in confusion.<br />
<br />
<br />
You sense no answers from the house to these questions, but you do feel like this unusual room is rather well-loved, despite the impracticality, and the sink full of slimy invertebrates of a mysterious origin.<br />
<br />
<br />
You see an eclectic assortment of mugs, an array of tea, coffee and several other hot drinks. You feel like if you wished for a drink, hot, cold or distressingly luke-warm, it would appear in front of you, quite possibly contained within an unusually sized handthrown mug, of something sleek and corporate, covered in octocats.<br />
<br />
The house wonders if you might need a snack, and points out the presence of bananas. You notice an avocado next to them, and try not to let the house hear that you are thinking that it looks rather inferior, and is not the shining example of avocado-perfection that you have become accustomed to at home, you fancy git.<br />
