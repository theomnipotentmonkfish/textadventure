	The Living Room
	</title>
</head>
<body>
You open the internal door and find yourself inside a living room. Compared to the outside, this place feels a little more solid, more believable.<br />
The walls are dark grey, and, if you are feeling cold, there is a fire going in the fireplace.<br />
<br />
<br />
The mantelpiece above this has some strange objects on it, several photographs of ferrets, and a small bird inside a clock, who hoots at you and tells you the time. You try not to look too closely at the really unsettling...glossy... naked ceramic man. <br />
A print of a frog looks down at you, very disapprovingly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Next to the fireplace is a large shelf of board games. Interesting-looking ones, with really nice boxes.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a large corner sofa which has quite a lot of cushions and blankets on it. A small fox sits on the back, amongst other creatures, on his ear is a wooden peg, it has "you look like you need a good pegging" written on it.<br />
Steady on, you think, raising your eyebrow. It reminds you of a field in Devon, and, weirdly, you feel an overwhelming desire to find some fish. Perhaps a passing holographic fairy might know where to find some, you catch yourself thinking. You faintly hear a song about drunken sailors (and what to do with them) playing from a mysterious source.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a television, connected to a computer, who tells you that his name is Cuboid Robert (Cubey Bob to his friends). You turn him on (he likes this, and whirrs his fans appreciatively).<br />
On the desktop you can see a shortcut for Spotify. Actually, you can't, because shortcuts are ugly, and desktops should be as empty as possible. These things are pinned in the start menu instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are two doors in this room, one looks like it leads into a kitchen, and the other must go into the tower that you noticed when you were outside.<br />
