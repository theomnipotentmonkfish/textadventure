You walk back into the kitchen, to look for some ferret treats. You see that the House has conveniently left out a box of eggs on the side for you.
You <span class="collapsible">open the box.</span> 
<div class="content">

</div>
Taking the egg with your name on it, and being careful not to scare the others, you crack it into a bowl and mix it up. You are not quite sure how you know what the ferrets want, but Angus was staring at you *very* intently. Perhaps he is telepathic. He was certainly trying very hard.<br />
<br />
<br />
You walk back up to the ferret enclosure, where there are now three weasels sitting in the balcony, staring at you intently. You open the balcony door:<br />
