    The Music Shelves
	</title>
</head>
<body>
This set of shelves is full of cds, with a collection of vinyl underneath.  You can see a nice looking hi-fi elsewhere in the library, a nice set of separate units that stack on top of each other. It seems to have the ability to play anything, even, though you are not sure why this would be needed, minidisks.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a small desk nearby there is a strange contraption. It has dials, gauges and satisfying knobs (anything with a satisfying knob *must* be good, right?).<br />
