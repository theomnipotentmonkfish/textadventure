You look down at the contraption, it has a small sign on it that says "Album Generator 3000".<br />
<br />
<br />
You twiddle one of the satisfying-looking knobs, it does not move and appears to be stuck on a setting called "sad music for coding".<br />
<br />
<br />
You notice there is a microphone hanging in front of it, with a post-it note on it which says "Ask".<br />
<br />
You lean closer to it, and say:<br />
<br />
""<br />
<br />
The machine gurgles, it chimes, it makes strange squeaking noises and generally sounds quite alarming. Eventually, with maybe a little steam involved, a handwritten cd case, with a newly burnt cd inside of it,  is forcibly ejected from a slot onto the desk.<br />
