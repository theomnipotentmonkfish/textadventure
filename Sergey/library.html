You walk through the door into the tower, this first room seems to be used to store things, in various wooden boxes. You get the same feeling of slight unrealness that you felt outside.<br />
<br />
Another door leads to a spiral staircase within the tower, you go up one floor and it opens out into a room that looks like a library, mixed with a workshop. The stairs continue upwards, but this seems to lead to some bedrooms, so you walk into the library.<br />
