	The Porch
	</title>

<body>
You walk up a few stone steps and through the door of the house. You find yourself in a porch.<br />
What a fine collection of stompy boots, you think, as you look around the very small room.<br /> 
Hanging on hooks there are a few cloaks, and some very practical looking waterproofs, as well as a triangular hat.<br />
Hanging separately is a wax jacket that smells, somewhat disturbingly, of ferrets. You check, but there are no ferrets inside the jacket.<br />
Reassured that your toes are safe, you remove your shoes.<br />
