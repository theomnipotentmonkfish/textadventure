You step out of the portal and find yourself in a quiet area of woodland, during your favourite season. Presumably, this means that it is unreasonably hot.<br />
You have the feeling that this place is not entirely real, but in a way that is comfortable, rather than unsettling.<br />
<br />
<br />
The trees are mixed deciduous, with a very prominant ancient oak just up the path from you, that has extremely aestheically pleasing twisted branches.<br /> 
You walk up to it and look up at the canopy.<br />
The leaves and branches form endless patterns extending upwards in layers, with the sun (clearly you are imagining sun) making the leaves glow with that particular luminosity only seen in leaves lit from above.<br />
There are some wooden chairs underneath this tree, they look suprisingly comfortable, and you can see that the canopy is dense enough to provide some truly excellent shade. Just as well really, given the change in weather that occured when you showed up. You realise your friend would quite like sitting here in the rain too. An all-weather tree then.<br />
<br />
<br />
A squirrel shouts at you, with that weird, weird noise that shouting squirrels make. You can hear a number of birds from where you are, the most noticeable being a crow that is standing on a nearby rock, making a really interesting selection of sounds. You hear caws, clicks, and odd little chirping, mumbling sounds from him. You step out from under the canopy, and look up. You notice a couple of buzzards circling.<br />
<br />
<br />
Beyond the this area you see a house. It has a tower! Behind it you can see a very large copper beech tree, which sounds like it is full of magpies who want you to know that this tree is full of magpies. They are not subtle birds.<br />
This looks like the house of a wizard, you think, but you know it is the house of your friend. Perhaps your friend is a wizard? Either way, they have an excellent house.<br />
It is made mostly of stone, with a bit of timber framing. For some reason, as if the knowledge just appeared in your mind, you know it is built with Portland stone.<br />
<br />
<br />
More Wizardry?<br />
Quite possibly.<br />
