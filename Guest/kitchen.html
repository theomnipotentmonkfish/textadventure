You walk into a kitchen. <br />
<br />
<br />
Gosh! What an inordinate number of oddly sized shelves, you think. <br />
So much... wood, you marvel.<br />
What a complete lack of... any kind of cupboard.<br />
What a large array of cocktail ingredients and coffee paraphanalia, you muse.<br />
Why is the sink full of miniature slugs?! You exclaim in confusion.<br />
<br />
<br />
You sense no answers from the house to these questions, but you do feel like this unusual room is rather well-loved, despite the impracticality, and the sink full of slimy invertebrates of a mysterious origin.<br />
<br />
<br />
You see an eclectic assortment of mugs, an array of tea, coffee and several other hot drinks. You feel like if you wished for a drink, hot, cold or distressingly luke-warm, it would appear in front of you.<br />
